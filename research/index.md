Social science relies on statistical inference, but social systems are full of interdependencies that violate the foundational assumptions of most statistical models, and coupled social-environmental systems even more so. My research aims to grapple with the effects of interdependence on environmental behavior and the implications for environmental policy. I use computational tools to study networks of people, concepts, and institutions, to understand why relationships they form the way they do, what we can learn from their patterns, and how they affect behavior of individuals and systems. 

## What does "sustainability" really mean?

Sustainability is famously nebulous. This project takes a detailed look at how sustainable agriculture is understood by the experts who deliver agricultural knowledge to growers. I run workshops in agricultural regions around California and have crop advisors, county extensionists, producer group representatives, and other experts draw mental models---detailed representations of the causal structure underlying their understanding---of sustainable agriculture. This is an iterative, participatory process through which they develop a better understanding of their own model and how it fits with the community's understanding. From the resulting data, I construct individual mental models and a group consensus model, from which I can make inferences about the meaning of sustainable agriculture---key concepts, leverage points, and relationships between processes and goals---and how it varies over geography, professional role, experience, etc. I can also use the maps as expert representations of the system to run simulations and examine the effects of policy interventions and environmental change.

## What can we infer from the patterns of ties in a farmer social network?

	<figcaption>Observed levels of clustering can only be reproduced in simulation with a term for triadic closure. Clustering builds bonding social capital to solve cooperation dilemmas such as environmental management. That we observe clustering at levels so far above chance suggests that growers are using social ties to build cooperation.</figcaption>

This project examines the structure of information ties among viticulturists. From those structural patterns, I draw conclusions about social aspects of the decision context in which growers operate. For example, open network structures suggest a collaborative environment in which information seeking and innovation diffusion flourish. In contrast, closed networks structures suggest an environment in which trust building is important, for example to solve environmental cooperation dilemmas. With Mark Lubell.

## What drives adoption of environmental certifications?

What drives farmer participation in voluntary environmental programs such as USDA Organic certification? In this project, we found that for established programs where benefits are well developed, farm size and its attendant economic resources and incentives are a principle driver. For newer programs, where benefits are less immediate, social networks play a dominant role as the community decides whether or not to buy in to the program.

## What do parameter estimates on geometrically-weighted terms in statistical models of networks really tell us?

Geometrically-weighted statistics have become an important part of exponential random graph models, but they are poorly understood and widely misinterpreted. This project uses analytic evidence, simulation, and a case study to bring light to the interpretation of parameters on geometrically weighted statistics and their implications for interpretation of statistical models of networks.

## How will climate change and management alternatives affect the dynamics of wildfire, vegetation, and homeowner behavior in a Southern California wildland-urban interface?

Wildfire is a significant and growing threat in California and firefighting resources are stretched thin. As a [SESYNC graduate pursuit](https://www.sesync.org/news/mon-2015-10-19-1400/rfp-socio-environmental-synthesis-research-for-graduate-students), myself and five other graduate students, all from different disciplines and universities, are developing a model that couples vegetation and fire dynamics to homeowner behavior in San Diego's wildland-urban interface. I am leading the agent-based model of defensible space adoption. With Patrick Bitterman, Ellen Esch, Katie Lyon, Michael Saha, and Kenny Wallen.
