My research seeks to understand how relationships affect environmental behavior and the implications for environmental policy. I use computational tools to study relationships: not just among people, but also concepts and institutions, to understand why they form the way they do, what we can learn from their patterns, and what effects they have on behavior. 

## Mental Models of Sustainable Agriculture

Sustatinability is famously nebulous. This project takes a detailed look at how sustainable agriculture is understood by the experts who deliver agricultural knowledge to growers. I run workshops in agricultural regions around California and have crop advisors, county extensionists, producer group representatives, and other experts draw mental models---detailed representations of the causal structure underlying their understanding---of sustainable agriculture. This is an iterative, participatory process through which they develop a better understanding of their own model and how it fits with the community's understanding. From the resulting data, I construct individual mental models and a group consensus model, from which I can make inferences about the meaning of sustainable agriculture---key concepts, leverage points, and relationships between processes and goals---and how it varies over geography, professional role, experience, etc. I can also use the maps as expert representations of the system to run simulations and examine the effects of policy interventions and environmental change.

## Learning Networks of Winegrape Growers

	<figcaption>Observed levels of clustering can only be reproduced in simulation with a term for triadic closure. Clustering builds bonding social capital to solve cooperation dilemmas such as environmental problems. That we observe clustering at levels so far above chance suggests that growers are using social ties to address cooperation dilemmas.</figcaption>
</figure>

This project examines the structure of information ties among viticulturists. From those structural patterns, I draw conclusions about social aspects of the decision context in which growers operate. For example, open network structures suggest a collaborative environment in which information seeking and innovation diffusion flurish. In contrast, closed networks structures suggest an environment in which trust building is important, for example to solve environmental cooperation dilemmas. With Mark Lubell.

## Adoption of Environmental Certifications

What drives farmer participation in voluntary environmental programs such as USDA Organic certification? In this project, we found that for established programs where benefits are well developed, farm size and its attendent economic resources and incentives are a principle driver. For newer programs, where benefits are less immediate, social networks play a dominant role as the community decides whether or not to buy in to the program.

## Interpretation of Statistical Models of Networks

Geometrically-weighted statistics have become an important part of exponential random graph models, but they are poorly understood and widely misinterpreted. This project uses analytic evidence, simulation, and a case study to bring light to the interpretation of parameters on geometerically weighted statistics and their implications for interpretation of statistical models of networks.
