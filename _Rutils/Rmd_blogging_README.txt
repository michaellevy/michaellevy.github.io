- .Rmd files go in _Rmd
- source Rutils/knitpost
- call knitpost('file-name') or knitAll()
- .md file should land in _posts/blog/
- On bundle exec jekyll build, .html should end up in _site/blog/new-post_title/index.html
	- Not sure where these came from, but they don't seem to do anything:
		- _posts/blog/_site
		- _site/post-titles
- image paths are specified as images/, so specify, e.g. as blog/my-image.png
