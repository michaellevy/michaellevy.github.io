Here is a video recording of my talk from useR! 2016 on teaching R. It's nominally about teaching a lot of students in an intensive format, but I think almost everything translates to traditional classes. If for whatever reason this video isn't working out for you, [here is the source](https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/useR-international-R-User-conference/useR2016/Teaching-R-to-200-people-in-a-week).

This talk was just one in a great session. I'd highly recommend:

- [Colin Rundel on integrating software development practices into R instruction](https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/useR-international-R-User-conference/useR2016/Continuous-Integration-and-Teaching-Statistical-Computing-with-R)
- [Mine Cetinkaya-Rundel on her undergraduate data science course](https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/useR-international-R-User-conference/useR2016/A-first-year-undergraduate-data-science-course)
- [Amelia McNamara on her efforts to get R instruction into high school classrooms](https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/useR-international-R-User-conference/useR2016/Integrated-R-labs-for-high-school-students)
- [Andee Kaplan the intRo platform for teaching R](https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/useR-international-R-User-conference/useR2016/Introducing-Statistics-with-intRo)
