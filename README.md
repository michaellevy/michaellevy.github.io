# Skinny Bones Jekyll Site

This is my personal professional website, viewable over at [michaellevy.name](michaellevy.name).

## Notes to self

**RMarkdown blogging**

	- .Rmd files go in _Rmd
	- source Rutils/knitpost
	- call knitpost('file-name') or knitAll()
	- .md file should land in _posts/blog/
	- On `bundle exec jekyll build`, .html should end up in _site/blog/new-post_title/index.html
	- image paths are specified as images/, so specify, e.g. as blog/my-image.png

Blog teaser images should be 1.5-1 width-height
