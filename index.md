I am a PhD Candidate in Environmental Science and Policy at the University of California, Davis where I work with Mark Lubell in the <a href="http://environmentalpolicy.ucdavis.edu/" target="_blank">Center for Environmental Policy and Behavior</a>. I am interested in how people understand sustainability and what drives sustainable behavior. My research focuses on relationships: among concepts, individuals, and institutions. I use a variety of computational tools to understand those relationships: network analysis, agent-based models, and Bayesian multi-level statistical models. As part of my PhD, I am working on [projects]({{ site.url }}/research) on experts' mental models of sustainable agriculture, social networks in vineyard management, drivers of environmental certification adoption, interpretation of statistical models of networks, and the interplay of homeowner behavior and wildland-urban fire dynamics.
