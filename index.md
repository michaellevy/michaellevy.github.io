Hi, I'm Michael. I am a PhD Candidate in Environmental Science and Policy at the University of California, Davis where I work with Mark Lubell in the <a href="http://www.google.com" target="_blank">Center for Environmental Policy and Behavior</a>. I am interested in how people understand sustainability and what drives sustainable behavior. My research focuses on relationships: among sustatinability concepts, individuals, and institutions. I use a variety of computational tools to understand those relationships: network analysis, agent-based models, and Bayesian multi-level statistical models. My dissertation focuses on sustainable agriculture, and I also have projects on broader water-use behavior, fire defensible-space behavior, and general social network processes and analysis.
