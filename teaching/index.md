The satisfaction that comes with helping students understand something they want to get or turning them on to something I care about is the most immediately gratifying aspect of my career. 

## Current
During my PhD, I have been fortunate to not have to teach to "pay the bills". Nonetheless, I TA-ed Lorien Jasney's Network Analysis in R course for ICPSR in the summer of 2015, and I developed and delivered a week-long intensive introduction to R for graduate students and postdocs. 

My "R Bootcamp" sought to take newcomers to coding and in one week get them to the point where they could A) help themselves using resources like R help files and Stack Overflow, and B) go into a statistics class and be sufficiently comfortable and competent with R that they can focus on the statistical concepts instead of constantly wrestling with code.

The response to the class was overwheliming. Over 350 UC Davis graduate students and postdocs signed up for the week-long intensive course. I delivered the class to 200 (pictured at the top of this page), and by all accounts it was a success. Here is a blog post I wrote just after the class reflecting on how it went. I am currently soliciting institutional support to offer the course as a proper, for-credit class in the spring of 2016.

## Prior
Unintentionally, teaching has been the thread that has tied my adult life together. I TA-ed chemistry labs as an undergraduate, taught English in South Korea for two years, and taught MCAT writing and wrote authored tests for The Princeton Review. During my master's, I TA-ed introductory and environmental biology, and I taught sections of WVU's capstone Biology class in which teams of undergraduates execute a research project from start to finish. 

## Philosophy, briefly
I take the responsibility of teaching seriously and am always looking for ways to improve. In addition to the training that came with the above mentioned teaching positions, I am currently (fall 2015) enrolled in a college teaching seminar, and I am a trained instructor with Software Carpentry, which is at the frontier of computational pedagogy. Much of what I have written below is stolen from Software Carpentry.

Teaching is a performance art, and my first task as a teacher is to get and hold my students attention. Enthusiasm goes a long way. Student motivation must preceed details, so I start with the payoff and circle back to the nuts and bolts. For example, in my R bootcamp, the students were making beautiful plots within the first hour, and then over the course of days I filled in the details of how the plotting functions work and how to customize them.

 In my computational classes, I code live in front of the students at every turn. Live coding has a number of benefits:

 - It shows the process, rather than just the product, of writing code.  
 - I make mistakes which makes it okay that the students are making mistakes and shows them how I diagnose and fix problems.  
 - It forces me to slow down. Teachers often move too fast for students because they already understand the concepts while the students have to put them together. This is critical for teaching computation. Writing all but the simplest line of code is stacking together many concepts and lots of syntax that the teacher often takes for granted because they are so familiar (this is language fluency!). The speed at which I write code (and annotate it, which slows me down even more and provides students another channel through which to grok what I'm doing) happens to be a good match for the speed at which students can absorb it.
 - It allows me to be responsive.
 - It provides a clear record of everything I taught, which I provide to the students in realtime through a Dropbox link. 

There are mountains of evidence that students learn better by doing than by hearing, so I break frequently to have students complete exercises, which generally become more complex and open-ended over the course of a session or topic. Sometimes they are solo exercises, other times they progress from individual to small group to whole class discussions. I ask for feedback often from my classes. Sometimes this takes the form of a multiple choice question that I use to assess how well students understand the material, other times I ask students how well they understand a topic and open ended questions about what is and isn't working for them. Google Forms makes this trivially easy and quick, and it helps me optimize my pace and methods. It has the additional benefit of showing students that I care and am responsive to their needs.
