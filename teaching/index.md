From TA-ing chemistry labs as undergraduate to teaching at an after-school academy in South Korea to developing the "R Bootcamp" pictured above, teaching has been the thread that has tied my adult life together. I find teaching immensely satisfying. My current teaching interests are primarily methodological: I love turning students on to the power of computational tools and helping them understand statistical concepts.

## Current
It looks like I will TA Richard McElreath's outstanding [computational Bayesian statistics course](http://xcelab.net/rm/statistical-rethinking/) in the first quarter of 2016. In the summer of 2015, I TA-ed Lorien Jasney's Network Analysis in R course for ICPSR, and I developed and delivered a week-long intensive introduction to R for graduate students and postdocs at UC Davis.

The "R Bootcamp" sought to take newcomers to coding and in one week get them to the point where they could A) help themselves using resources like R help files and Stack Overflow, and B) go into a statistics class and be sufficiently comfortable and competent with R that they can focus on the statistical concepts instead of constantly wrestling with code.

## Previous
I have taught in a variety of settings and fields. I TA-ed chemistry labs as an undergraduate, taught English in South Korea for two years, and taught MCAT writing and authored tests for The Princeton Review. During my master's, I TA-ed introductory and environmental biology, and I taught sections of West Virginia University's capstone Biology class in which teams of undergraduates execute a research project from start to finish. 

## A few thoughts on teaching
I take the responsibility of teaching seriously and am always looking for ways to improve. In addition to the training that came with the above-mentioned teaching positions, I am currently enrolled in a college teaching seminar, and I am a trained instructor with Software Carpentry, which is at the frontier of computational pedagogy. Much of my thinking about teaching comes from Software Carpentry. I wrote an extended blog post reflecting on my recent experience teaching R to 200 people in a week, which you can read [here](/blog/teaching-r-to-200-students-in-a-week/). 

Teaching is a performance art, and my first task as a teacher is to get and hold my students attention. Enthusiasm goes a long way. Student motivation must preceed details, so I start with the payoff and circle back to the nuts and bolts. For example, in my R bootcamp, the students were making beautiful plots within the first hour, and then over the course of days I filled in the details of how the plotting functions work and how to customize them.

 In my computational classes, I code live in front of the students at every turn. Live coding has a number of benefits:

 - It shows the process, rather than just the product, of writing code.  
 - I make mistakes which makes it okay that the students are making mistakes and shows them how I diagnose and fix problems.  
 - It forces me to slow down. Teachers often move too fast for students because they already understand the concepts while the students have to put them together. This is critical for teaching computation. Writing all but the simplest line of code is stacking together multiple concepts and lots of syntax that the teacher often takes for granted because they are so familiar (this is language fluency!). The speed at which I write code (and annotate it, which slows me down even more and provides students another channel through which to grok what I'm doing) seems to be a good match for the speed at which students can absorb it.
 - It allows me to be responsive.
 - It provides a clear record of everything taught, which I can provide to students in real-time. 

There are mountains of evidence that students learn better by doing than by hearing, so I break frequently to have students complete exercises, which generally become more complex and open-ended over the course of a session or topic. Sometimes they are solo exercises, other times they progress from individual to small group to whole class discussions. I ask for feedback often from my classes. Sometimes this takes the form of a multiple choice question that I use to assess how well students understand the material, other times I ask students how well they understand a topic and open ended questions about what is and isn't working for them. Google Forms makes this trivially easy and quick, and it helps me optimize my pace and methods. It has the additional benefit of showing students that I care and am responsive to their needs.
