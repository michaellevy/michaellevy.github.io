## Davis
I am a PhD Candidate in the department of Environmental Science and Policy at the University of California, Davis where I am lucky to work with some wonderful people. My affiliations at Davis include:

- [Graduate Group in Ecology](http://ecology.ucdavis.edu/), [Environmental Policy and Human Ecology Emphasis](http://ecology.ucdavis.edu/programs/EPHE/programinfo.html)  
- [Center for Environmental Policy and Behavior](http://environmentalpolicy.ucdavis.edu)  
- [Quantitative Biology and Epidemiology Lab](http://qbelab.plantpathology.ucdavis.edu/)  
- [Davis R-Users' Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/davis-rug)  
- [Data Science Initiative](http://datascience.ucdavis.edu/)  
- [Professors for the Future](https://gradstudies.ucdavis.edu/professional-development/professors-future)
- [Climate Change, Water, and Society IGERT](http://ccwas.ucdavis.edu/)  

## Previous
Prior to my PhD, I got my MS in Biology from West Virginia University studying the ecological development of strip-mines. I lived abroad for a few years, mostly teaching English as a Foreign Language in South Korea, but also backpacking around Asia and the Middle East. Before that I got my BS in Chemsitry from Fort Lewis College in beautiful Durango, Colorado.

## Personal

When I'm not reading, writing, or coding, I enjoy getting outdoors and pushing myself athletically. The summer between my MS and PhD, I thru-hiked the Colorado Trail, ran a 100-mile trail race in southern Oregon, and did the "rim-to-rim-to-rim" double-crossing of the Grand Canyon. Davis is central to an incredible variety of outdoor places. While here, I have surfed Santa Cruz, walked among the biggest, tallest, and oldest trees in the world, and backpacked through some of the greatest alpine terrain anywhere. I also spend a lot of time running and biking on the farm roads around Davis on which Dave Scott trained for his six Ironman world championships. I'm nearly certain it's the particular roads that gave Dave his strength and that they will have the same effect on me.
