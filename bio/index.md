## Davis
I am a PhD Candidate in the department of Environmental Science and Policy at the University of California, Davis where I am lucky to work with some wonderful people. My affiliations at Davis include:

- [Graduate Group in Ecology](http://ecology.ucdavis.edu/), [Environmental Policy and Human Ecology Emphasis](http://ecology.ucdavis.edu/programs/EPHE/programinfo.html)  
- [Center for Environmental Policy and Behavior](http://environmentalpolicy.ucdavis.edu)  
- [Quantitative Biology and Epidemiology Lab](http://qbelab.plantpathology.ucdavis.edu/)  
- [Davis R-Users' Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/davis-rug)  
- [Data Science Initiative](http://datascience.ucdavis.edu/)  
- [Professors for the Future](https://gradstudies.ucdavis.edu/professional-development/professors-future)
- [Climate Change, Water, and Society IGERT](http://ccwas.ucdavis.edu/)  

## Prior
Prior to my PhD, I got my MS in Biology from West Virginia University studying the ecological development of strip-mines. I lived abroad for a few years, mostly teaching English as a Foreign Language in South Korea, and before that I got my BS in Chemsitry from Fort Lewis College in Durango, Colorado.

## Personal

<figcaption>My ideas of fun.</figcaption>
When I'm not reading, writing, or coding, I enjoy getting outdoors and pushing myself athletically. The summer between my MS and PhD, I thru-hiked the Colorado Trail, ran a 100-mile trail race in southern Oregon, and did the "rim-to-rim-to-rim" double-crossing of the Grand Canyon. Davis is centrally located to a wealth and variety of outdoor places, and during my PhD, I have surfed Santa Cruz, walked among the biggest, tallest, and oldest trees in the world, and backpacked through some of the greatest alpine terrain anywhere. I also spend a lot of time on the farm roads around Davis training for triathlons, the same roads on which ironman-extraordinare Dave Scott trained. I assume that his success was due to the particular roads he trained on and that they will have the same effect on me.
